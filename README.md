# Optimization-Techniques
### What is optimization?
Maximizing or minimizing some function relative to some set,often representing a range of choices available in a certain situation.<br>
The function allows comparison of the different choices for determining which might be “best”. <br> <br>
Optimization is an esoteric technique used mainly in mathematics and operations research related activities. <br>
With the advent of computers, optimization has become a part of computer-aided design activities. <br>
It is primarily being used in those design activities in which the goal is not only to achieve just a feasible design, but also a design objective.<br>
### Common applications:<br>
Minimal cost, maximal profit, minimal error, optimal design,optimal management, variational principles. <br>
I have tried to implement certain optimization techniques using Python.
